        I am currently a fourth year student majoring in Business and Computer
        Science at the University of British Columbia. Growing up, I have had an
        avid interest in technology. From tinkering with Lego blocks to creating
        a fully independent application, I have always been passionate about
        using my creative mindset to build innovative solutions.

        I have primarily worked with applications using .NET Famework with C#,
        VueJS, and ReactJS during my internship at RBC. My work with databases
        used T-SQL with Microsoft SQL Server, and the Entity Framework
        Repository Pattern. However, on the side I am working effortlessly on
        becoming a more experienced C++ developer.

        My other hobby includes playing the piano. What my peers viewed as
        dreadfully long practices, I saw as an opportunity to play the music I
        loved. My commitment to learning dramatically improved my piano skills,
        and placed me top three in the British Columbia Registered Music
        Teachersâ€™ Association, and successfully completing Grade 9 for the Royal
        Conservatory of Music and Arts.

        exponentially, it is crucial for business leaders to maintain both a
        technological and qualitative mindset to remain a valuable competitor.
