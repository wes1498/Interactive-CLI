          Growing up, I have had an avid interest in technology. From tinkering with Lego blocks to creating a fully independent application, I have always been passionate about using my creative mindset to build innovative solutions.

          My other hobby includes playing the piano.

My commitment to learning dramatically improved my piano skills, and placed me top three in the British Columbia Registered Music Teachersâ€™ Association, and successfully completing Grade 9 for the Royal Conservatory of Music and Arts.
